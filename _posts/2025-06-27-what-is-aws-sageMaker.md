AWS SageMaker is a platform provided by Amazon that enables data analysis,
processing, ML and AI model development across an organisation's data sources
already hosted in AWS.

Using what they call a "lakehouse architecture", SageMaker combines data from
Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift. The architecture then allows processing and
analysis to be performed on the data without external processing pipelines to
clean and structure the data as needed.

This tool is aimed at building more traditional machine learning models but with
the rise of generative AI it has also included the ability to build AI models on
data that a company already owns.

In the future Amazon want to connect this with other tools such as Amazon
Kinesis (for data streaming), Amazon QuickSight (for business intelligence), and
Amazon OpenSearch Service (to provide in-product search capabilities). These
extensions will take SageMaker in the direction of more hands-on use by
non-data-science experts, spreading the impact of data analysis across an
organisation.

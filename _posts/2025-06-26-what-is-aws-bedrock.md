AWS Bedrock is a managed service provided by Amazon on AWS that allows companies
to build applications that utilise AI in their own products. A number of
different foundation models (FM) are available. A notable exclusion to this list
is OpenAI.

This enables companies running on AWS to utilise AI APIs from within the same
data centres that their applications run in, reducing response times and
combining billing into one invoice. The goal is to make it as easy as possible
for AWS customers to use AI in their products while paying for the privilege.

Having access to multiple models through the same API also allows developers to
quickly iterate. Testing different models on different applications can yield
different results. Being able to use the same API to test and deploy an
application makes it easy to pick the right model for the task.

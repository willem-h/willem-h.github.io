We all want to be part of something important. Some of us want to be the face of
it. Others are fine with playing a minor role. We just want to know that what we
do means something.

I remember loving working with Dad on things that he was doing. There was
something about being invited into the world how he saw it; being there to accomplish something with him. Whether that was landscaping the backyard, fixing
a pipe or setting up a new computer, it was always important.

There was also the security of being with him and learning from him. I had no
cares but to do what he was doing. I didn't have to pay for the fuel or worry
about how the project was going to look in the end. I would follow his lead and
help him realise his vision.

Jesus has the same connection with his Father.

Seeing this parallel with our own natural fathers isn't too surprising. God
created family and it only makes sense that he would imprint his character on
it.

What is surprising is that Jesus would invite us into the perfect relationship
that he has with his father, as we see in Matthew 11:27.

Jesus opened up the way so that we might have an intimately close relationship
with the ultimate Father. Not that we would be slaves to do his bidding, but
that we would be friends who know his heart.

Once we're ready to be with him, we're ready to do with him. 

Not the other way around.

God doesn't want us to become perfect before we approach him. In fact, we can't.
I'm just as broken as the next man out there. When we try to do this in our own
strength we only get weighed down with burdens we were never made to carry. God
created us to be free in his love and to revel being with him. As we spend time
with him, we learn more about what makes him who he is. We see the heart he has
for people and as we learn how he loves, we can't help but love in the same way.

What's even more awesome is God invites us into his story! Just like Dad
inviting me into what he's doing around the house, Jesus opens the door to the
world and asks us to join him as he does his Father's work! He gives us each a
role to play in the ultimate story! We know it's important because he is
important.

That's something I can get behind. Will you join me?

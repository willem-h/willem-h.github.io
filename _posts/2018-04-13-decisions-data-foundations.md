So youâ€™ve decided you want to make decisions with data. Whoop whoop ðŸŽ‰

Letâ€™s set a solid base together on how this can happen practically for you and
your team.

Firstly, letâ€™s start with the small and valuable. What decisions do you
consistently have to make? What decisions do you make every day? Every week?
Every month? List them. Be specific. The more specific you can be the easier it
will be to find potential efficiency improvements.

Secondly, think about what information you need to make these decisions. List it
out. And again, be specific. What information is needed? Who has it? Where is it
stored? How can it be accessed? Why is it needed?

Having a picture of the repetitive decisions that are made and the information
needed helps to highlight potential for increased efficiency. Sometimes this
could be an improvement in communication between people or additional training.
On the other hand, maybe a more technical solution is required where anything
from basic dashboards to complex modelling provides the best value to your
specific situation.

Once youâ€™ve got this, applying data driven decision making in your organisation
can move more easily from hype to reality.

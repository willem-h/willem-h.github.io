> “Ideas are easy, execution is everything”
> - John Doerr

I discovered the above quote while watching Casey Neistat and it has stuck with me. At the time I was trying to think of something I could turn into an app. It brought my perspective in closer to what’s around me. What’s a problem I could fix right now?

Having recently finished secondary school I started to read again with the spare time I had in the transition period. I picked up books I owned and had already read before but it made me realise just how much I missed it. I started to ask my friends for recommendations and was introduced to some excellent books such as Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts and King Raven by Stephen R. Lawhead. I loved how easy it was to find good books this way and this is what inspired OpenShelf.

I had the idea. Now to execute.

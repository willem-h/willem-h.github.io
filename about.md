Hi, I'm Willem and this blog is my way of sharing the things I've learned about software with the world (as well as some other small things I find interesting).

I'm excited by software and what it can mean for myself, my friends, and globally. I've got 6.5 years working for a charity as both a full-stack software engineer and a data and analytics engineer. I've also built a couple of small projects that can be found at {% include icon-github.html username="willem-h" %}.

I recently graduated from my Bachelor of Computer Science and am on the hunt for my next opportunity. In my spare time I like reading (C.S. Lewis anybody?), photography (on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/willemhandreck/)) and hiking.

If you want to get in contact feel free to shoot me an email.

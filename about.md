Hi, I'm Willem and Project Alpha is my way of sharing the things I've learnt about software with the world (as well as some other small things I find interesting).

I'm excited by software and what it can mean for myself, my friends and globally. I've built a couple of small projects that can be found at {% include icon-github.html username="willem-h" %} while my largest, [OpenShelf](http://openshelf.me), has become a usable platform for sharing books with friends.

I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne majoring in Computing and Software Systems. In my spare time I like reading (C.S. Lewis anybody?), photography (on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/willem.c.h/)) and hiking.

If you want to get in contact feel free to shoot me an email.

Here's a list of referral links that'll get us a both a little kick-back. Feel free to use them if you'd find it helpful.

## YNAB

YNAB is my budgeting tool of choice. It allows us to use whatever bank account structure we want but the source of truth for what we can spend in each category is in YNAB. It's a little bit on the pricey side but we find it worth it.

If you use this link to sign-up and eventually subscribe, we'll both receive a free month.

## Aussie Broadband

Aussie Broadband is our internet provider. We're currently on Australia's NBN FTTP network and we've had no issues and the speed has been great. One of their major selling points is their customer support but I haven't needed to use them so I can't vouch for that myself.

If you use this on the checkout page when signing up we'll both receive a credit between $20-$100 depending on what type of service you sign up for.
